# Design

### Features I want to achieve
1. Login in with Google, Facebook & Local 
2. Have users to keep track of these information


#### Schemes for users 
```ts
@Scheme()
User {
  _id: string;
  authTyep: string; // it could be google, facebook or other third party that allows OAuth2.0
}


```


### Problems I met
##### Task 1: If a user signin with google, facebook... how to store in database ?
Problems:
1. Facebook id and google id maybe the same, it will collision
2. How do I find a user in db if a user has already signin with google 

Thoughts:
1. When user signin, I only has OAuth type(e.g google) and its id
2. Mongo autogenerated **_id** is unique, but how it relate with OAuth type and id
3. When a Google user signin, I first want to find it in my db, at the time I only have
googleid and I know it is from google, so first I can go to Google DB, and try to find the 
User.
4. But it will be complicated, because later on I may have Meta DB, TwitterDB...
5. So I only want one type of user, the user contains information about its authtype and id
6. Now I have a user, has **_id** (Mongo id), **authtype**(google, meta, github..), **thirdParty_id**
so one authType can't have two same ids, so this structure of User makes sure it will not cause collision
, because I can find a user through authType and id, it will guarantee to give me a unique user
